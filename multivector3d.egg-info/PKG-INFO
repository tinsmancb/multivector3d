Description: # Multivector3D
        Basic python class for a 3D multivector, implemented using numpy for efficient
        numerical computation. The following operations are implemented:
        
        ```python
        from multivector3d import Multivector3D
        
        a = Multivector3D(vector=[1,2,3])
        b = Multivector3D(bivector=[4,5,6])
        c = 2.0
        ```
        
        * `a+b` Addition
        * `a*c` Scalar multiplication (limitation: scalar must be on the right)
        * `a/c` Scalar division
        * `a*b` Geometric product
        * `a.dot(b)` Dot product
        * `a^b` Wedge product
        * `~a` Dual multivector (multiplication by unit pseudoscalar)
        
        The multivector attributes for the four grades, each of which can be specified
        in the constructor:
        
        * `a.scalar` Scalar
        * `a.vector` Vector, in the canonical `{e_1, e_2, e_3}` basis
        * `a.bivector` Bivector, in the `{e_2 e_3, e_3 e_1, e_1 e_2}` basis
        * `a.pscalar` Pseudoscalar `e_1 e_2 e_3`.
        
        This project is more of an academic exercise than anything production ready at
        this point. If you want to do computations with the geometric algebra in python,
        check out the [clifford](https://clifford.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The package can be installed from pip: `pip install multivector3d`. The only 
        dependency is numpy.
